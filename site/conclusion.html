                    <hr>
                    <h3 class="subsection-text">What have been done?</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the basis of BDI and Kripke models specified in 'Problem Description' section
                        a model has been built. This model consists of two main parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Civilization model.</i> This part describes a model used to represent a civilization.
                                Each civilization consists of a number of basic parameters:
                                <ul class="parameters">
                                    <li>Name. A civilization chosen name.</li>
                                    <li>Attitude. A general outlook towards other societies in space. Malevolent civilizations
                                        generally strive to destroy civilizations they encounter, while benevolent ones
                                        are much more likely to try and make contact with alien society.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Technical level. A real number in range <code>0-10</code>.
                                        This number represents technical prowess of the population.
                                        It being a real number constitutes subtle difference even between
                                        civilizations of the same scale. During an armed conflict this parameter
                                        defines who wins and who dies.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Depth of suspicion. An integer number in range <code>0-7</code>.
                                        Represents societal arguments about other civilization's attitude. Is it worth
                                        making contact, if another society may be malevolent? Or, maybe, if another society
                                        is benevolent, but thinks that we are malevolent and may try to destroy us anyway?
                                        During the lifetime of a benevolent civilization this parameter defines its chances
                                        to make a preemptive strike, to hide ot to make contact.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>State automaton. A representation of BDI model. Possible actions to take at any
                                        given point in time. Slightly different for different types of civilizations. For
                                        example, a malevolent society does not have an opportunity to make contact, while
                                        benevolent civilization does not consider a possibility of outright extermination
                                        of another society.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Statistics gathering engine.</i> This engine is based on running a number of encounters
                                between two civilizations. By the end of the encounter each of two civilizations either
                                defended itself by destroying other civilization and survived alone, prevailed and
                                destroyed the other one (hence also surviving alone), hid and thus removed a possibility
                                of destruction or cooperated with other one.
                                We provide a command-line based text interface that allows user to:
                                <ul class="parameters">

                    during the second rotation and try to destroy them. But, unfortunately for them, Klingons apparently
                    had a quite advanced tech and were able to completely wipe The Reavers out. Klingons survive.

                        United Federation detect each other right away. The Culture - quite uncharacteristically -
                        attempts a preemptive strike against UF, sending it to oblivion and beyond.

                        An example of an encounter between player and a benevolent civilization. Player has utmost control
                        over simulation and decides that his civilization will surely discover the other one on the first
                        turn. Then the player, being fairly naive, tries to hail the other civilization to cooperate with
                        them. He succeeds though. And they lived happily ever after.
                    <pre>

                            with dreams of cooperation but those get shuttered right away when player perform Exterminatus

                    <p> First of all it is evident that approximately 74.12% (741221 out of 1000000) of all encounters
                        end with a destruction of one of participating civilizations. This number is bad news for any
                        society trying to make contact in Big Universe. Approximately two thirds of those are deaths of
                        malevolent civilizations. This is understandable, as malevolents always go for an armed confrontation
                        and have a 50% chance of having a higher tech level. Benevolents only make preemptive strikes or
                        try to defend themselves. When they are trying to defend they again have a 50% chance of succeeding.
                        Other deaths can be explained by preemptive strikes.
                    <p> We distinguish a number of possible strategies for each civilization:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Destruction. "Destroy or be destroyed" as they say. This is a way that only malevolent civilizations
                             take. Destruction of another civilization as soon as it is detected. Though it should be
                             taken into account that sometimes another civilizations may prove quite resourceful, hence in
                             16.27% of encounters benevolent civilization manages to repel assault
                        </li>
                        <li> Preemptive strikes. Sometimes event benevolent civilizations may be forced to take action.
                             If one expects another one to strike first it may try to make a preemptive strike to be even
                             faster. This kind of action was initiated in 4.832% of benevolent-benevolent encounters. </li>
                        <li> Stealth. Go into hiding is always an option for any civilization. If one just sits put and
                             tries to do everything to stay undetected - it may actually survive. This accounts for 13.69%
                             of all encounters in this particular mode</li>
                        <li> Cooperation. The ultimate goal of any benevolent society. This is dangerous as it implies that
                             this society trusts another one with info about its location and state.
                             This outcome constitutes 12.18% of encounters</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> It should also be noted that <strong>depth of suspicion</strong> has great influence over preferred course of actions
                    of a benevolent civilization. The higher it is the more likely civilizations is to regard another one
                    as being benevolent in nature and hence the more likely it is to make contact.
