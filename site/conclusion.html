                    <hr>
                    <h3 class="subsection-text">What has been done?</h3>
                    <p>
                        On the basis of the BDI and Kripke models specified in the 'Problem Description' section
                        we have built a model that allows us to simulate encounters between civilizations with various properties.
                        This model consists of two main parts:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <i>Civilization model.</i> The civilizations and their properties are described in this part of the model:
                                <ul class="parameters">
                                    <li>Name. A name for the civilization.</li>
                                    <li>Attitude. A general outlook towards other societies in space. Malevolent civilizations
                                        generally strive to destroy civilizations they encounter, while benevolent ones
                                        are much more likely to try and make contact with an alien society.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Technical level. A real number in the range of <code>0-10</code>.
                                        This number represents technical prowess of the population.
                                        It being a real number constitutes subtle difference even between
                                        civilizations of the same scale. During an armed conflict this parameter
                                        defines who wins and who dies.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Depth of suspicion. An integer number in the range of <code>0-7</code>.
                                        Represents societal arguments about other civilization's attitudes. Is it worth
                                        making contact, if another society may be malevolent? Or, maybe, if another society
                                        is benevolent, but thinks that we are malevolent and may try to destroy us anyway?
                                        During the lifetime of a benevolent civilization this parameter defines when it
                                        preemptively strikes, when it hides, or when it tries to make contact with another
                                        civilization.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>State automaton. A representation of the BDI model. It defines what possible actions
                                        a civilization can take at any given point in time. The state automaton is slightly
                                        different for different types of civilizations. For example, a malevolent society
                                        does not have an opportunity to make contact, while a benevolent civilization does
                                        not consider a possibility of instant extermination of another society.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li><i>Statistics gathering engine.</i> To be able to quickly gather statistics of multiple
                                encounters, we have also implemented a way to automate the simulation of any specified
                                number of encounters. By the end of the encounter each of two civilizations either defended itself
                                by destroying other civilization and survived alone, or it prevailed and destroyed the other
                                civilization (thus, also surviving alone), or it hid and thus removed a possibility of destruction or
                                it cooperated with the other civilization. We provide a command-line based text interface that allows
                                user to:
                                <ul class="parameters">
                                    <li>Do a manual simulation of one particular encounter.</li>
                                    <li>Do an interactive simulation of one particular encounter, where the player
                                      assumes the role of one of the societies participating in an encounter.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Do a user-specified number of simulations, gather statistics, and present them upon completion.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                    during the second rotation and try to destroy them. But, unfortunately for them, Klingons apparently
                    had a quite advanced tech level and were able to completely wipe The Reavers out. Klingons survive.

                        An example of an encounter between a human-controlled and a benevolent civilization. The player
                        has control over simulation and decides that his civilization will surely discover the other one on the first
                        turn. Then the player, being fairly naive, makes a risky move by trying to hail the other civilization to cooperate with
                        them. He succeeds though. And they lived happily ever after.

                    <p> First of all it is evident that approximately 74.12% (741221 out of 1000000) of all encounters
                        end in the destruction of one of participating civilizations. This number is bad news for any
                        society trying to make contact in the Big Universe. Approximately two thirds of those are deaths of
                        malevolent civilizations. This is understandable, as malevolent civilizations always go for an armed confrontation
                        and have a 50% chance of having a higher tech level. Benevolent civilizations only make preemptive strikes or
                        try to defend themselves. When they are trying to defend during an encounter, they again have a 50% chance of succeeding.
                        Other deaths can be explained by preemptive strikes.
                    <p> We distinguish a number of possible strategies for each civilization:
                    <ul>
                        <li> Destruction. "Destroy or be destroyed" as they say. This is a path that only malevolent civilizations
                             walk: persue destruction of another civilization as soon as it is detected. Though it should be
                             taken into account that sometimes another civilizations may prove quite resourceful, hence in
                             16.27% of the encounters, benevolent civilization manages to repel the assault.
                        </li>
                        <li> Preemptive strikes. Sometimes even benevolent civilizations may be forced to resort to violence.
                             If one civilization expects another one to strike first it may try to make a preemptive strike
                             as a way to prevent this. This kind of action was initiated in 4.832% of benevolent-benevolent encounters. </li>
                        <li> Stealth. Go into hiding is always an option for any civilization. If one just sits put and
                             tries to do everything to stay undetected, it may actually stay unnoticed, and survive. This accounts for 13.69%
                             of all encounters in this particular run.</li>
                        <li> Cooperation. The ultimate goal of any benevolent society. This is dangerous as it implies that
                             this society trusts another one with information about its location and state.
                             This outcome constitutes 12.18% of encounters</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p> It should also be noted that <strong>depth of suspicion</strong> has great influence over preferred course of actions
                    of a benevolent civilization. The higher it is, the more likely a civilization is to regard another one
                    as being benevolent of nature, therefore the more likely it is to make contact.
