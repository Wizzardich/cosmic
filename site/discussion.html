                    <p> The model we developed focuses on a single civilization to civilization encounter. Its main
                        purpose is to define a most reasonable strategy for an emerging civilization. As can be seen
                        from our results (presented on a "Conclusion" page), almost three quarters of all encounters
                        result into one of the participating civilizations ending up dead. On the contrary, due to
                        the specifics of our model any civilization that decided to hide will survive. The cooperation
                        as a strategy is a quite dangerous effort that really proved itself beneficial in only 12.18%
                        of all encounters
                    <p> It is important to note, however, that as we do not have an ability to establish real values for
                        some of the parameters of the model our conclusion may be different from real world. For example
                        a 50% chance to discover another civilization in close vicinity may be as high as 100% or as low
                        as 0%.

                    <p> There is also a number of improvements that may be introduced to our model:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Stealth mechanics can be improved. In our current model if civilization goes into hiding it
                            cannot be uncovered anymore. Even if another civilization had already detected it cannot cause
                            any harm to a hiding one. This may represent a total migration of a civilizations somewhere
                            else or an unwillingness and evasion of any contacts with its peers. However it is reasonable
                            to account for a possibility of the civilization just being harder to locate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In our model the only representation of time is a simultaneous change of states in civilization
                            driving automatons. This is a problem, as it does not provide a real time based simulation. In
                            this case it would be possible to implement chain of suspicion in a way described by its author,
                            Liu Cixin, and allow preemptive strikes to be more time-efficient.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As was already mentioned above. Model is driven by a number of probabilistic parameters that
                            define possibility of action to be taken. These are:
                            <ul class="parameters">
                                <li>
                                    The probability of malevolent civilization to perform a destroy action against its
                                    adversary. Currently set at 90%
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The base probability of benevolent civilization trying to make contact. Currently set
                                    at 90%, is heavily influenced by chain of suspicion mechanics.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Technological advantage given to a civilization making a preemptive strike against
                                    another one. Currently set to increase technological level for this encounter by 2
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Penalty given to a civilization making a contact attempt. Currently set to decrease
                                    technological level for this encounter by 2
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As mentioned above detectability of a civilization. Currently set at 50% for every
                                    civilization.
                                </li>
