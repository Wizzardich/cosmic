                    <p> The model we developed focuses on a single civilization to civilization encounter. Its main
                        purpose is to define a most reasonable strategy for an emerging civilization. As can be seen
                        from our results (presented on a "Conclusion" page), almost three quarters of all encounters
                        result into one of the participating civilizations ending up dead. On the contrary, due to
                        the specifics of our model any civilization that decided to hide will survive. The cooperation
                        as a strategy is a quite dangerous effort that really proved itself beneficial in only 12.18%
                        of all encounters
                    <p> It is important to note, however, that as we do not have an ability to establish real values for
                        some of the parameters of the model our conclusion may be different from real world. For example
                        a 50% chance to discover another civilization in close vicinity may be as high as 100% or as low
                        as 0%.
                    <p> Our results make a concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter">Great Filter</a>
                        feel perfectly reasonable. If real numbers are really close to those produced by our model then
                        it really is beneficial to hide, as this course of actions is almost guaranteed to lead to the
                        survival of the civilization.

                    <p> There is also a number of improvements that may be introduced to our model:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Stealth mechanics can be improved. In our current model if civilization goes into hiding it
                            cannot be uncovered anymore. Even if another civilization had already detected it cannot cause
                            any harm to a hiding one. This may represent a total migration of a civilizations somewhere
                            else or an unwillingness and evasion of any contacts with its peers. However it is reasonable
                            to account for a possibility of the civilization just being harder to locate.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In our model the only representation of time is a simultaneous change of states in civilization
                            driving automatons. This is a problem, as it does not provide a real time based simulation. In
                            this case it would be possible to implement chain of suspicion in a way described by its author,
                            Liu Cixin, and allow preemptive strikes to be more time-efficient.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As was already mentioned above. Model is driven by a number of probabilistic parameters that
                            define possibility of action to be taken. These are:
                            <ul class="parameters">
                                <li>
                                    The probability of malevolent civilization to perform a destroy action against its
                                    adversary. Currently set at 90%
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The base probability of benevolent civilization trying to make contact. Currently set
                                    at 90%, is heavily influenced by chain of suspicion mechanics.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Technological advantage given to a civilization making a preemptive strike against
                                    another one. Currently set to increase technological level for this encounter by 2
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Penalty given to a civilization making a contact attempt. Currently set to decrease
                                    technological level for this encounter by 2
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As mentioned above detectability of a civilization. Currently set at 50% for every
                                    civilization.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            One of the main concerns of cosmic sociology is the availability of resources. As specified
                            in the second axiom, resources in universe are finite, and any civilization needs to grow.
                            This means that sooner or later any benevolent civilization will come to a point where it
                            will desperately need a new and steady income of supplies. This is a question that should
                            may arise during contact with another civilization.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The previous point directly leads to a possibility of different civilizations changing their
                            allegiances. For example there may be a point, when hitherto benevolent civilization may become
                            malevolent.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Our model does not reuse civilizations in further encounters. It is possible to modify it in
                            such a way that prior history of a still-alive civilization would have a strong influence over
                            its current disposition
                        </li>

                    <p> Taking into account all that is said above, our model is a nice basis that can model a more general
                    cosmic society. For example, it can be embedded into a
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_game_theory#Classical_game_theory">evolutionary
                    game theory</a> framework.
                    <p> Suppose we have a galactic society consisting of a number of independent civilizations which can be regarded
                    as a population. In light of recent discoveries made by Kepler space telescope there are reasons to
                    believe that almost any star in the galaxy has a planetary system and many of those actually host
                    planets that are located inside a Goldilocks zone. This means that a significantly large number of
                    civilizations is actually possible.
                    <p> Game rules are defined by our encounter model. It may or may not be expanded with previously stated
                    suggestions. Another suggestion that applies for this scenario and should be considered in this model
                    is knowledge sharing between cooperating civilizations: information about encounters, possible alliances
                    and possible technology sharing.
                    <p> We suggest replication rules based on a number of successful encounters for every given civilization.
                    <p> Replication may represent not a full change of society, but some small mutations still may occur.
                    For example increase or decrease of tech level may represent a progress or stagnation of society, change
                    of effective depth of suspicion may mirror previous experiences, and of course, change of attitude is
                    also a possible occurrence.

                    3. Argue about preemptive strikes. Bush doctrine.
                    4. Humans and deterrence
                    <p> Preemptive strikes as used by benevolent civilizations actually can be found in a real world history.
                    For example, an infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Doctrine">Bush Doctrine</a> described
                    a strategy of "preemptive strikes" as a defense against an immediate threat to the security of the United States.
                    Reasoning about possible attitude of the United States is left as an exercise to the reader.
                    <p> One may say that it is not really "benevolent" in any way to perform any kind of preemptive strikes,
                    but this is not a focus of this project.
